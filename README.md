# Image Analyst MKII pipelines for mitochondrial membrane potential assaying using TMRM and FLIPR probes
The method presented here provides unbiased, absolute calibrated (millivolts) values of both ΔψP and ΔψM in intact, cultured or immobilized isolated live cells. The key advantage compared to semi-quantitative techniques is that ΔψM is determined in an absolute scale with no a priori assumptions on cell geometry or ΔψP, allowing comparisons of specimens, using microscale samples, down to single cells.  
[This repository](https://github.com/gerencserlab/IA-MMP/) contains custom image analysis pipelines for Image Analyst MKII, used in publications (and more):
- [Unbiased millivolts assay of mitochondrial membrane potential in intact cells](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9377305/)
- [Metabolic activation-driven mitochondrial hyperpolarization predicts insulin secretion in human pancreatic beta-cells](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000527281830152X?via%3Dihub)
